# devdocs-mac-app
An unofficial Mac application that wraps DevDocs.io

The default keyboard shortcut for opening and hiding is
Control + Option + Space

Accessibility permissions are required for registering the global event handler (for switching to the app)

Recommended to be put in fullscreen mode as sometimes in windowed mode the app doesn't return focus to the previous app after hiding
